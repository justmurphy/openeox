# Flexera Use Cases

**Background:**

Flexera owns and maintains [Technopedia](https://www.flexera.com/products/technopedia), the most trusted and comprehensive source of hardware, software, SaaS, and cloud product information in the world. Technopedia includes information about more than 5 million hardware and software products, along with end of life (EOL) and end of support (EOS) data for many these products. Flexera’s research team populates Technopedia with EOL/EOS data from vendor websites and partner service providers.

Technopedia plays a key role in Flexera’s [Technology Intelligence Platform](https://www.flexera.com/products/flexera-one/technology-intelligence-platform). This solution organizes, refines, and structures the customer’s raw IT data into a consolidated and categorized listing of all of the customer’s hardware and software assets. When this normalized list of assets is enhanced with the EOL/EOS data in Technopedia, the customer is able to quickly identify tech debt and protect against threats. The customer can use the contextualized information in the Technology Intelligence Platform to prioritize the remediation of unsupported hardware and software.

**Use cases:**

1. **Standardized import of EOL/EOS data.**

   - Challenge: The Flexera research team currently obtains EOL/EOS data from vendor websites and partner service providers. Every vendor and service provider has a different way of reporting this data. Flexera is forced to set up a different approach for each vendor to import this data.
   - Solution: OpenEoX offers a common mechanism for vendors to publish EOL/EOS data via standard formats and APIs. The Flexera research team can use this API to rapidly and effectively maintain Technopedia.
   - Benefit: Flexera customers of Technopedia and the Technology Intelligence Platform have more timely, accurate, and comprehensive EOL/EOS data to support their tech debt and threat reduction programs.

2. **Simplify and promote OpenEoX adoption.**

   - Challenge: Software and hardware vendors may find it difficult to adopt and support OpenEoX. They may find it difficult to maintain a database of dates, generate OpenEoX-compliant data, and offer OpenEoX-compliant APIs.
   - Solution: Flexera provides a service to software and hardware vendors enabling the storage, creation, and retrieval of OpenEoX data via OpenEoX-compliant APIs.
   - Benefit: A barrier to OpenEoX adoption is removed, allowing the entire ecosystem to more rapidly benefit from the OpenEoX standard.
