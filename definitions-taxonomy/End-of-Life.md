# End-of-Life (EoL) Definition

The End-of-Life (EoL) indicates the last day when the particular product (or the product version/release) is officially supported in any way by the vendor. After this date there shouldnâ€™t be more development, updates or any type of support expected from the vendor. The existing customers are also impacted by this product lifecycle stage and should consider migration to the still supported product version or release.
