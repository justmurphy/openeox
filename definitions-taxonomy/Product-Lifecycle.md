# Product Lifecycle Definition

Every product type (software, hardware, managed service and other deliverables) can be associated with a lifecycle model. It can contain definitions of various support models (different levels of maintenance) in association to the product versioning convention. The lifecycle support model can be dynamic and might change over time, from the product's initial release (General Availability) to its discontinuation (End-of-Life). During the product lifecycle, support models may switch from one state to another and may even run in parallel to meet individual requirements. Those requirements may depend on the product type, the vendor offerings, as well as geographical related regulations.
